# LZ77vsZSTD
Work on comparison of compression algorithms Lempel-Ziv '77 (LZ77) and Zstandard (ZSTD).

Topic: Assessing the compression efficiencies of LZ77 and Zstandard algorithms.

Research Question: How does the compression algorithm of the LZ77 technique compare to the Zstandard technique in relation to the ratio of uncompressed to compressed text blocks?
